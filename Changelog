TODO
- savoir si lorsque erreur il faut enlever ou pas l'argument en erreur de la stack
  - normalement non, c'est bon?

Compatibility is broken on these points
- `<< <<` doesn't input as `<< << >> >>` but as `<< << >>`
- `1 2+` not allowed anymore, keep `1 2 +`
  - this correct bad behaviors like `3b114` giving `3b11` and `4`
- complexes are written in the form `(1,2)` instead of `(1, 2)` (the space was removed)

New
- `« »` are valid as program delimiters. `<<` and `>>` are still valid
- enhanced code quality and memory usage checks
